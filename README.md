# Ticket Management System

A comprehensive ticketing system designed to streamline support requests. This application allows customers to submit tickets, agents to manage them, and administrators to oversee the entire system.

## User Roles

The system supports three distinct user roles, each with specific permissions:

*   **Customer**: Can create new tickets and view their own existing tickets.
*   **Agent**: Can view and manage tickets that are assigned to them.
*   **Admin**: Has full oversight of the system. Admins can manage all tickets, users, priorities, and statuses.
